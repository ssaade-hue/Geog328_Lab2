## GEOG328_Lab2 — Publish instructions

This repository contains a small static site for a GEOG 328 lab. The site can be published on GitHub Pages.

Quick checklist to publish

1. Make sure the repository is public (or you have a Pages-enabled plan for private repos).
2. Confirm `index.html` is at the repository root and committed.
3. In the GitHub repository UI: Settings → Pages → Source: choose `main` branch and folder `/ (root)` then Save.
4. Wait ~30–60 seconds and visit: `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Geog328_Lab2/index.html`

Local preview

Open a simple HTTP server from the repository root and preview locally (macOS):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser
```

Notes and troubleshooting

- If you see a 404 after enabling Pages, wait a minute for the site to publish. Try HTTPS.
- Remove any `CNAME` file or custom domain settings unless you're using them and have DNS configured correctly.
- A `.nojekyll` file is included to ensure files/folders beginning with `_` are served.

If you want, I can also create a small GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy automatically (not necessary for a simple static site).
