            <h2>Pioneer DJ — background & context</h2>
            <p>Pioneer DJ (now part of AlphaTheta) has been a leading manufacturer of DJ equipment for professional and hobbyist DJs since the company's establishment. They produce a wide range of hardware including mixers, media players (CDJ series), multi-format players, and DJ controllers like the DDJ series.</p>

            <h3>DDJ-FLX4 — about</h3>
            <p>The DDJ-FLX4 is an entry-level 2-channel DJ controller designed to lower the learning curve for new DJs. It focuses on ease-of-use while still providing creative tools such as performance pads, easy effects controls, and compatibility with major DJ software platforms. It is designed for practice, small events, and home use.</p>

            <h3>Why this matters</h3>
            <p>Pioneer DJ devices (including the DDJ-FLX4) shape how many DJs learn mixing and performance. Their hardware and software integrations influence performance workflows and music selection practices in clubs, streaming, and home studios. Including a Pioneer DJ controller as the visual backdrop ties the project to contemporary DJ technology and practice.</p>
